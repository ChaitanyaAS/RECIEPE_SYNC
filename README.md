Recipe Management System - DBMS Project
This project is a Recipe Management System developed using Database Management Systems (DBMS) concepts. The system allows users to manage and store recipes, including their ingredients, categories, preparation instructions, and user ratings. The database is designed to efficiently handle queries such as adding, updating, and retrieving recipes based on ingredients or categories. The project demonstrates the application of SQL queries for data manipulation, normalization, and creating a structured schema to optimize recipe management. This system serves as a practical example of using relational databases to manage real-world data in an organized way.
